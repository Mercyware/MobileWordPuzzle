<string name="about_text">\

This game is played just like regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to

win a tile you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\

\n\

A tie happens when there are no further moves. In the case of a tie in a small

board, that will count as a win for both sides in the larger game.
